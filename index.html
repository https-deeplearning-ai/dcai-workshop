		    <p>Data-Centric AI (DCAI) represents the recent transition from focusing on modeling to the underlying data used to train and evaluate models. Increasingly, common model architectures have begun to dominate a wide range of tasks, and predictable scaling rules have emerged. While building and using datasets has been critical to these successes, the endeavor is often artisanal -- painstaking and expensive. The community lacks high productivity and efficient open data engineering tools to make building, maintaining, and evaluating datasets easier, cheaper, and more repeatable. The DCAI movement aims to address this lack of tooling, best practices, and infrastructure for managing data in modern ML systems.</p>

<p>The main objective of this workshop is to cultivate the DCAI community into a vibrant interdisciplinary field that tackles practical data problems. We consider some of those problems to be: data collection/generation, data labeling, data preprocess/augmentation, data quality evaluation, data debt, and data governance. Many of these areas are nascent, and we hope to further their development by knitting them together into a coherent whole. Together we will define the DCAI movement that will shape the future of AI and ML. Please see our call for papers below to take an active role in shaping that future! If you have any questions, please reach out to the organizers (<a href="mailto:neurips-data-centric-ai@googlegroups.com">neurips-data-centric-ai@googlegroups.com</a>)

<p class="text-faded">The ML community has a strong track record of <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">building and using datasets for AI systems</span>.
	But this endeavor is often artisanal—painstaking and expensive.
	The community lacks high productivity and efficient open data engineering tools to make building, maintaining and evaluating datasets easier, cheaper and more repeatable.
	So, the core challenge is to accelerate dataset creation and iteration together with increasing the efficiency of use and reuse by democratizing data engineering and evaluation. <br><br>

If 80 percent of machine learning work is data preparation, then <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">ensuring data quality</span> is the most important work of a machine learning team and therefore a vital research area.
	Human-labeled data has increasingly become the fuel and compass of AI-based software systems - yet innovative efforts have mostly focused on models and code.
	The growing focus on scale, speed, and cost of building and improving datasets has resulted in an impact on quality, which is nebulous and often circularly defined, since the annotators are the source of data and ground truth [Riezler, 2014].
	The development of tools to make repeatable and systematic adjustments to datasets has also lagged.
	While dataset quality is still the top concern everyone has, the ways in which that is measured in practice is poorly understood and sometimes simply wrong.
	A decade later, we see some cause for concern: fairness and bias issues in labeled datasets [Goel and Faltings, 2019], quality issues in datasets [Crawford and Paglen, 2019],
	limitations of benchmarks [Kovaleva et al., 2019, Welty et al., 2019] reproducibility concerns in machine learning research [Pineau et al., 2018, Gunderson and Kjensmo, 2018],
	lack of documentation and replication of data [Katsuno et al., 2019], and unrealistic performance metrics [Bernstein 2021].<br><br>

We need a framework for <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">excellence in data engineering</span> that does not yet exist. In the first to market rush with data, aspects of
	maintainability, reproducibility, reliability, validity, and fidelity of datasets are often overlooked. We want to turn this way of thinking on its head and highlight examples,
	case-studies, methodologies for excellence in data collection. Building an active research community focused on Data Centric AI is an important part of the process of defining
	the core problems and creating ways to measure progress in machine learning through data quality tasks. <br></p>

                <p>
                    Large-scale vision benchmarks have driven—and often even defined—progress in machine learning. However, these benchmarks are merely proxies for the real-world tasks we actually care about. How well do our benchmarks capture such tasks?
                    <br><br>
                    In this talk, I will discuss the alignment between our benchmark-driven ML paradigm and the real-world uses cases that motivate it. First, we will explore examples of biases in the ImageNet dataset, and how state-of-the-art models exploit them. We will then demonstrate how these biases arise as a result of design choices in the data collection and curation processes.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout, we illustrate how one can leverage relatively standard tools (e.g., crowdsourcing, image processing) to quantify the biases that we observe.

                <p>
                    Models trained on large unlabeled corpora of human interactions will learn patterns and mimic behaviors therein, which may include offensive or otherwise toxic behavior and unwanted biases. I will discuss several methods for mitigating these issues in neural dialogue models. In particular, I will highlight the use of iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop data collection and model training procedures for the purpose of making chatbots robust to adversarial attack from humans. In opposition to static benchmarks, these approaches yield a “moving goalpost” for natural language understanding systems, and recent work shows that models trained on these increasingly complex tasks are more robust to adversarial attack.

                <p>
                    NIST's Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and TRECVID evaluations of multimedia search are long-running evaluation workshops that develop datasets for search ranking, classification, and other AI tasks, along with appropriate metrics that the research community can use to gauge progress in those tasks.  Since the start of TREC in 1991, NIST has developed a large store of practical experience in collecting, assembling, labeling, and measuring the quality of datasets.  In this brief talk, I will describe the history of TREC relevance assessments, the processes we use to do determine those labels, and research on how to make those processes more robust, reliable, and inexpensive.

                <p>
                    Crowdsourcing has enabled the collection, aggregation and refinement of human knowledge and judgment, i.e. ground truth, for problem domains with data of increasing complexity and scale. A lack of comprehensive diagnostic reference standards in medicine significantly increases the complexity of labeling medical data. Asynchronous adjudication, a newly introduced method of facilitating asynchronous discussions among remote healthcare professionals, has enabled the generation of such ground truth, i.e. medical diagnoses,  with high quality at scale, and consequently, the development of machine learning based medical applications.
                    <br><br>
                    In this talk, I will present the challenges of managing labellers, who often are medical experts, involved in asynchronously adjudicating medical labels. The discussion will focus on what information labellers find important to doing their jobs efficiently, and how such information impacts their work’s speed and quality. I next propose improvements to the current asynchronous adjudication mechanism. Last, I will describe a novel patented async adjudication expansion, designed and built to address the challenges of resolving disagreements among experts on visual annotations of medical images.

                    Managing large amounts of data in a rigorous way is key to the success of ML initiatives. Yet, we still find that many organizations often do not have a complete view of their data, leading to sub-optimal and biased solutions. What can we learn from the world of software development to build a better-controlled system? How can the creation of controlled datasets become less of an art and more of a science?

                    The AI industry is collectively fielding tens of thousands of ML applications, many of which require human-labeled data (HLD) for training, evaluation or production “patching”. We identify business and operational challenges to producing high-quality HLD at scale, and review the pros and cons of common organizational solutions: outsourcing HLD to third-party vendors, insourcing HLD to a product or engineering sub-team, insourcing HLD to a specialized HLD function, letting science contributors fend for themselves, and hybrids of these.

                <h3 class="text-center">Towards Accountability for Machine Learning Datasets: Lessons from Software Engineering</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired demands for greater transparency and accountability. However the datasets which empower machine learning are often used, shared and re-used with little visibility into the processes of deliberation which led to their creation. In this talk, I introduce a rigorous framework for dataset development transparency which supports decision-making and accountability. The framework uses the cyclical, infrastructural and engineering nature of dataset development to draw on best practices from the software development lifecycle. Each stage of the data development lifecycle yields a set of documents that facilitate improved communication and decision-making, as well as drawing attention to the value and necessity of careful data work. The proposed framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in artificial intelligence systems, by making visible the often overlooked work that goes into dataset creation.
